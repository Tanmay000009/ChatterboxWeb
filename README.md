## How It Works

- **Authentication**: Users authenticate via JWT tokens, allowing secure access to chats. Token validation occurs on every request.
- **Socket Connection**: Chatterbox uses Socket.io to manage real-time messaging. Once authenticated, a secure WebSocket connection is established for the session.
- **Socket Management**: Upon server connection, each user's socket ID is updated, and disconnected sockets are automatically cleaned up.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors such as token expiration or WebSocket disconnections.
